# Natural-Language-Processing
In this project, I've included a sample code snippet that showcases how to perform part-of-speech tagging and sentence tokenization using NLTK, a powerful natural language processing library in Python."

Feel free to modify this sentence or add more details as needed to suit the context of your project and the specific NLTK practices you want to highlight in your README.

Remember to provide any necessary instructions or dependencies for running the code snippet, such as installing NLTK or any additional packages required.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
